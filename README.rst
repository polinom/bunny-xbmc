For now it is one reliable way to install it. I dont want to move it to PiPy index till it ready.

``pip install https://github.com/polinom/bunny-xbmc/archive/master.zip``



Fast Start
----------
To create you very basic application you need make few steps:

  * Move to you `addons` folder.

     For example on Mac you would go to `Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons`

  * Then preform  bunny-create type appname

    For example: `bynny-create video fancyapp`

  * That's it! Now you can got to xbmc and check it out in you video addons. The app vil ne named 'fancyapp'
