To create you very basic application you need make few steps:

  * Move to you `addons` folder.

     For example on Mac you would go to ``Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons``

  * Then preform  ``bunny-create [type] [appname]``

    For example: ``bynny-create video fancyapp``

  * That's it! Now you can got to xbmc and check it out in you video addons. The app will be named 'fancyapp'
