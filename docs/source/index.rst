Welcome to bunny-xbmc's documentation!
======================================


Introduction
------------
Bunny Xbmc is a framework that makes development of fancy XBMC application fast.


Motivation
----------
It is pretty hard to find some good tutorials or examples how to develop good looking aplications on XBMC.
The only way to figure out how things work is to look inside someones code. Every applicaton is different.
Becouse there is no standart in this area. But XBMC is pretty nice media center.
And it would be very nice if people could take full advantage of it.


Goals
-----
To make easy to use and documented framework for XBMC script (applications) development.
